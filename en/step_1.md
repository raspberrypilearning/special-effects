## Suspense
Let's start by creating a sound to show that danger is approaching.



+ To create the first special effect you should add the `:ambi_choir` sample to am empty buffer.

+ You can change the __rate__ at which a sample is played. A `rate` of `1` is the sample's normal speed, and using a `rate` of less than 1 will slow the sample down.

+ Press 'Run' to hear your sample played slowly. How does the sample sound?

+ A `rate` higher than 1 speeds the sample up.

+ Test your sample again. How does it sound now?

+ You can repeat the sample a few times by putting it in a loop. You'll also need to add a `sleep` after playing the sample.

## Learning Objectives
+ Sonic Pi samples
+ Sample `rate` and `amp`
+ Using random values

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Create your own special effects" - using samples to create special effects.

## Frequently Asked Questions
+ To find samples available in Sonic Pi, learners can go to <a href="http://jumpto.cc/sonic-pi-samples">jumpto.cc/sonic-pi-samples</a>. Alternatively, they can just type `sample [space]` and choose from the list that appears.
